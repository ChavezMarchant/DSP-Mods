Regain control of your Build Bar! This mod allows to rebind any Build bar items as you desire.

![BarPreview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kremnev8/DSP-Mods/master/Mods/RebindBuildBar/rebind-showcase.gif)

Also you can see all bound items even if they are not unlocked and rebind them too. And last but not least you can bind items you haven't unlocked yet too.

To rebind either `Ctrl` click needed item or press `Ctrl+F1-10`. An item picker will popup and you will be able to rebind. <br/>
If you ever want to remove an item from build bar just `Middle mouse click` on that item.<br/>
To reset your settings to default you can press reset button on the bar. If you press it all items in `current` category will be reset to defaults. If you hold `Ctrl` when you press it, all items in `all` categories will be reset. All keybinds can be rebound. <br/>

All of your settings are stored in a config file located at `Dyson Sphere Program/BepInEx/config/RebindBuildBar/`.
